# Background and Introduction

While for many of us, wine is only for drinking or pairing with a nice meal, there is an elite group of investors and collectors<br>
collectors who seek to acquire rare bottles. In some cases these rare bottles are acquired for status, in other cases to enjoy,<br>
and often, to hold as an asset with the hope that the wine will appreciate in value. Like the art market, the wine market has<br> 
had little volatility while having greater returns than the stock market.<br>

As a result, more eyes have been on this market and bad actors have taken note and found ways to exploit this market.<br>
Wine fraud has existed as long as wine has been produced. Pliny the Elder once complained that not even the nobility of Rome<br>
could be assured that the wine they were drinking was unadulterated. A recent case of wine fraud left its mark on pop culture<br> 
through a Netflix documentary called Sour Grapes. Rudy Kurniawan, an Indonesian immigrant, splashed onto the wine scene in the<br> 
early 2000s. He was reportedly purchasing over $1MM of wine a month starting in 2006 and became known for hosting elaborate wine <br>
tasting parties. He later began consigning some of his impressive bottles to Christies along with auction houses that specialize<br>
in wine. Later it came to light that Kurniawan was adulterating wines by blending inexpensive wines and relabeling them as rare<br>
Burgundy vintages.  When the FBI searched his home they found cheap California wine along with notes saying what they would be<br>
masquerading as along with stamps, labels, and corks.<br>

The blockchain’s immutability makes it a natural solution for creating a clear picture of provenance and helping to prevent fraud.<br>
This solution can be further rolled out to trace wine from the point of production to improve integrity of both high value and consumer<br>
wine by providing a supply chain tracking solution that provides transparency for buyers.<br>

# Wine Supply Chain
![barrels](https://github.com/1monalisa1/CU-Capstone-Team-4/blob/main/png_file/barrels.png)<br>

New production of wine can be very complex depending on multiple factors including capacity of the producers, bottling facility<br>
constraints, route to market differences and other iterations of supply.  Our code controls for this by having consistent conditionals<br>
that are traceable at each step of the chain.<br>       

Wine also needs to be transported in very specific conditions to control for quality as it relates to temperature, humidity and<br>
unnecessary shaking to preserve price and quality.  The solidity code provides for quality checks across the supply chain so<br>
the consumer knows that the wine has not been tampered with or spoiled unintentionally.<br> 


# Methodology
![token](https://github.com/1monalisa1/CU-Capstone-Team-4/blob/main/png_file/token.png)<br>

Our team coded a solidity contract that created a nonfungible token (NFT) capturing a wine’s origin, producer, vintage, and varietal.<br>
This then would be used to track ownership of the token via the blockchain. As mentioned above, whereas the wine that most consumers<br> 
purchase, the supply chain ends with the person who initially purchases the wine, but with collectible wines there is a considerable<br> 
secondary market and many players introduced where there may be an opportunity for fraud. The NFT also needs to pass a quality check at<br>
every hand off to ensure authenticity.<br> 


# Conclusions

Reducing fraud in the wine industry increases the value of all legitimate wines as producers can be assured that their brands are<br>
not being diminished and consumers can be sure that they are buying, collecting, or investing in an authentic bottle. Currently, fraud<br>
is priced in as a discount and reducing or eliminating this fraud could give a lift to an already promising market. While it is hard to<br>
identify a firm number as far as how much wine is fraudulent, some statistics cite that nearly one in five bottles of wine is fraudulent<br>
Solving all or a part of this problem could eliminate this “discount” and give a ten percent or more boost to wine prices.<br>
